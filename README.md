## Kia Ora!
Hello and welcome. "Kia Ora" is the warm and welcoming greeting of the indigenous MƒÅori people of Aotearoa (New Zealand), where it is used across cultures and people groups as a replacement for "Hi!", whilst conveying a wish for good health.

## What is plus64.nz?
It is an initiative to invent a brand new architecture for voice-first communications, that is community owned, open source and cloud native. We aim to hunt, gather, enhance, supplement, integrate, test and deploy the best-of-breed open source voice communications components to create a new and open way forward for voice in the cloud. We aim to do this with an approach that draws from the best practices of open source and agile software development.

## What is the point?
There is a disparity between high cost business communication - based on on-premises or hosted PBX - and the practically free multimedia communication offered to private users through social platforms.


## Why the name plus64.nz?
:new_zealand: Aotearoa NZ - the land of the long white cloud, and the place of origination of this project. It has the international dialling code +64. So plus64.nz a nice, short and catchy domain name that references good ol' telephone dialling AND a cloud.
